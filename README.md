🚀 Just wrapped up a data analysis project on the IMDb Top 1000 movies!

Using SQL, and Excel,  I explored trends in genres, directors, IMDb ratings over decades, and the relationship between rating and box office revenue.

🧠 Key Insights:

🎭 Drama is the most dominant genre

🎬 Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg lead as top directors

⭐ The 1920s and 2020s surprisingly have the highest average ratings

📊 I turned these insights into a presentation to communicate my findings clearly and effectively.
